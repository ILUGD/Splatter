# Splatter

An easy to use tool to generate posters for meetups.

### Installation:

For the latest version:


`go get -u -v github.com/ILUGD/splatter`

You need to have your `$GOPATH` for this. 

If you are not a developer, we have binaries too,

```bash
wget https://github.com/ILUGD/splatter/releases/download/v0.1alpha/splatter
sudo cp splatter /usr/bin/
```

At the moment the program is only supported on Linux, for Windows or Mac, you need to follow the first method.

### Usage:

`splatter -config <configFileName>.json`

You can find one example config file in the `examples` directory.



**Note** : The program isn't yet complete or ready for usage
